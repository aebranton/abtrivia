# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Been a while so will note this for myself.
# Now, to effectively reset the DB after some testing:
# rails db:drop:_unsafe
# rails db:create
# rails db:migrate
# rails db:seed
# The last 3 are just there for completeness, but really the drop:_unsafe was what i missed
