This is the trivia application built a bit like HQ.

The design of the UI is pretty basic, as I wanted to focus on the coding.

Notes:
  * I have not bothered to do a media-size based CSS to make this look nicer on phones - in production of course we would. But I dont think thats overly impressive or something I need to spend time on here.
  * I have done a couple of things in different approaches sometimes (such as verifying a form via a model, or via JS) just to show I know both, even if its a basic implementation
  * You should note the footer ;)
  * Enjoy!
