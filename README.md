# README

This is the trivia application built a bit like HQ.

You can either hit Join Next Game to join the currently waiting game (if one exists) or start an auto-trivia. These games wait for only 2 people. More can join if it is within the startup time but they are more of a head-to-head.

You can also create a custom game for more players if you would like.

No game searching page for now. You always join the first available game to keep things moving and keep people from waiting ages for a round to start.

The design of the UI is pretty basic, as I wanted to focus on the coding.

Notes:
  * I have not bothered to do a media-size based CSS (or other approaches) to make this look nicer on phones - in production of course we would. But I dont think thats overly impressive or something I need to spend time on here. 
  * I have done a couple of things in different approaches sometimes (such as verifying a form via a model, or via JS) just to show I know both, even if its a basic implementation
  * You should note the footer ;)
  * Enjoy!
